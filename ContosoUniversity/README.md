In the tutorial there was no mechanism to enroll students in courses

1. The create new student page lists all courses offered by the university
    * checking a course will enroll a student in that course
2. The edit student page lists all courses offered by the university
    * courses students are enrolled in are checked
    * students can be enrolled in additional courses by checking them
    * students can be unenrolled from courses by unchecking them
    
Through the tutorial, the instructors index page allowed selection of an instructor, the page would repost and list all courses that instructor was teaching.  Then with the selection of one of those courses the page would repost again listing all the students in those courses with their grades.
* All that was moved to the instructor detail page
