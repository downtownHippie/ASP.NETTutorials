In the tutorial there was no mechanism to enroll students in courses

    Added mechanism to enroll students in courses when creating a new student
    
    Added mechanism to enroll and unenroll a student in courses when editing a student
    
In the tutorial, on the instructors index page you could select an instructor and the page would update
and include all courses the instructor was teaching.  then you could select one of those courses and the page
would update again listing all the students in those courses.

    All that was moved to the instructor detail page
    
TODO:
    
    Add department to instructor
    
        limit department administrator to one of department instructors
        
        limit instructor to only teaching classes offered by the department
        
    assign/change grades for students in classes
    
        either when editing a student or maybe when viewing students in a class
